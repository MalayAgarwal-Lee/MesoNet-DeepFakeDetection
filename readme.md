# <!-- omit in toc --> MesoNet - A Deepfake Detector Built Using Python and Deep Learning

The problem of misinformation has concerned me for a long time. Having witnessed the drastic effects of it in both my country and elsewhere, I think my concerns are rightly placed.

This project is an attempt at quelling some of those concerns.

## 1. Introduction

This is part of my final year project, as required to finish my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

It aims to solve a small part of the misinformation problem. In particular, I detail here my approach in implementing a CNN-based DeepFake detector, first detailed in a paper published by @DariusAf et al. in 2018 [[1]](#ref-1).
